## What Should You Do
```
Fork this repo
Clone this repo
Practice Java JDBC - connections, class and object
```

## How To Submit
```
Upon completion, run the following commands:

git add .
git commit -m "ProGrad ID"
git push origin master

And finally, create a pull request so your ProGrad Mentor (PM) can review your work.
```

## Instructions

1. ***Do not modify the entire code.***
2. ***Edit the code as per the instructions.***
3. ***Go to Java Resources -> src folder.***
4. ***You will have two packages src/controller and src/utility.***
5. ***Your database connection code should exist inside the utlity package.***
6. ***Once the progressions are completed follow the instructions to run the application and test your code.***
7. ***Add appropriate jars to your project directory.***
8. ***To add dependencies, right click on your project, select build path - configure build path - select libraries tab - select add external jars and add the downloaded jar files.***

## Required Dependencies
If you haven't downloaded OJDBC driver (ojdbc6.jar), then download using this link [https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/jdbcdriver-ucp-downloads.html]

## Progression 0:
1. ***Right click on src folder and select new - file and name it as jdbc.properties.***
2. ***You can use the jdbc properties given below in the NOTE section.***

## Progression 1:

1. **Create a class called as `ConnectionManager` inside the utility package.**
2. **Create a method public static Connection getConnection() which returns a connection object.** 
3. **Use the method public static Properties loadPropertiesFile() to load the jdbc properties from the jdbc.properties file.**

## Progression 2:

1. **Create a class called as  `Main` with main method inside the controller package.**
2. **Create an object for the Connection { java.sql.Connection }.**
3. **Call the getConnection() method in the ConnectionManager and store the return value in the Connection object.**
4. **Display "Connection established" if the connection is not equal to null else display "Check your connection".**

### Note:

Use the below code to retreive the connection details from jdbc.properties to establish connection
```
public static Properties loadPropertiesFile() throws Exception {
	Properties prop = new Properties();	
	InputStream in = ConnectionManager.class.getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("jdbc.properties");
	prop.load(in);
	in.close(); 
	return prop;
}
```
Create a file called as jdbc.properites. To create a file right click on the application - new - file - name the file as jdbc.properties.
```
jdbc.properties
#JDBC properties entry for ORACLE server
driver = oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver
url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe
username=your_username
password=your_password

```

**Sample Output - 1**
```Connection Established.```


**Sample Output - 2**
```Check your Connection.```
